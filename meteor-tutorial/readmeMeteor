client folder -> gets executed on the webbrowser

html files have no html tag.	


*** java script review: 

	(now let is used instead) var is used to define any type of variables. 
	console.log most values can be printed as strings using %s.

	simple for loops.

	can feed functios to functions.

	objects:
		var s = {
			name: "Roger",
			year: 2016,
			gender: "M"
			};

		can have no values or as many as you like.

	arrays:
		[];
		can contain different types and change types.
		array has properties, it is an object.
		can have infinite size.

	list of students is built as objects, call it section. Can use list as the for argument.


meteor directory -normally dont touch.

template tag is not in html - they are little modules.
also {{#each task}} gets each element in the task variable.

mongodB you dont define your tables(just as with java script).

idea of meteor is to not use mongodB but js;

in javascrip to add elements.
	fetch is to get object from db. Use insert command as in mongo.

	Installing packages:

		meteor add package_name (see athmophere)

		recommended: jquerry,
					 houston-admin -my admin,
