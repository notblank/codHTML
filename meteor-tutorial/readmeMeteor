client folder -> gets executed on the webbrowser
server folder -> gets executed on the server

html files have no html tag.	


*** java script review: 

	(now let is used instead) var is used to define any type of variables. 
	console.log most values can be printed as strings using %s.

	simple for loops.

	can feed functios to functions.

	objects:
		var s = {
			name: "Roger",
			year: 2016,
			gender: "M"
			};

		can have no values or as many as you like.

	arrays:
		[];
		can contain different types and change types.
		array has properties, it is an object.
		can have infinite size.

	list of students is built as objects, call it section. Can use list as the for argument.


meteor directory -normally dont touch.

template tag is not in html - they are little modules.
also {{#each task}} gets each element in the task variable.

mongodB you dont define your tables(just as with java script).

idea of meteor is to not use mongodB but js;

in javascrip to add elements.
	fetch is to get object from db. Use insert command as in mongo.

	Installing packages:

		meteor add package_name (see athmophere)

		recommended: jquerry,
					 houston-admin -my admin,

you will not access to most of the things in the local folder (execpt for packages).

local contains most of the info.

Client folder contains things  that run on the client side.
Server: idem but for server. 

vid #3
Adding React to meteor

meteor npm install 
meteor npm install --save react react-dom

vid #4
imports folder and components basics.

imports contians a client and a server folders. 
to avoid wrappings with if client, server things. 

App.js goes into client. Before importing you have to export the file.
	export default:  default is used to avoid { } when importing. 

React can have component states, events, or anything from java.

vid #5
react state. 

install package highlight jsx (already have babel)

before states add contructor. A method to set states. 
	super allows you to acces functions from object's parents.

	state refresh with the page.

Another important part is the parent-child relationships between components. 

	can put components inside components. 

	pass data from comonents to components.
	olny parent -> child direction

	<Heading count={this.state.count}/>

	count is defined as a prop of Heading.
